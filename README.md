# NER Error Suite


Suite of tools designed to identify any errors that are made by the Spacy NER in order to determine a set of rules that will allow for better performance.

## How to Use 
After download the file, 

In terminal, run the following command to install all packages needed
> pip install -r requirements.txt 

Then run streamlit to see the explortary statistics for the identified errors   
> streamlit run run.py 

Note that the program might not function normally. At present the database is not avaiable because my AWS account is private and needs login credentials.
